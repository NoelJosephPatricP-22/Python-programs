#length=float(input('Enter the length of the rectangle:')): This line prompts the user to input the length of a rectangle. The input() function takes the user's input as a string, and float() converts it into a floating-point number because length, breadth, and height can be decimal values. The entered length is then stored in the variable length
length=float(input('Enter the length of thebrectangle:'))
#breadth=float(input('Enter the breadth of the rectangle:')): This line prompts the user to input the breadth of the rectangle. Similar to the previous line, it converts the input into a floating-point number and stores it in the variable breadth.
breadth=float(input('Enter the breadth of the rectangle:'))
#height=float(input('Enter the height of the rectangle:')): This line prompts the user to input the height of the rectangle, converts it into a floating-point number, and stores it in the variable height.
height=float(input('Enter the height of the rectangle:'))

#volume=length*breadth*height: This line calculates the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the length, breadth, and height together, storing the result in the variable volume.
volume=length*breadth*height

#print('\nVolume of the rectangle is:',volume): This line prints the calculated volume of the rectangle. The \n in the string adds a newline character, so the output starts on a new line. Then, it prints "Volume of the rectangle is:" followed by the value stored in the variable volume.
print('\nVolume of the rectangle is:',volume)
