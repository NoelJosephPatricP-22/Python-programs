#number1 = float(input('Enter the first number:')): This line prompts the user to input the first number. The input() function takes the user's input as a string, and float() converts it into a floating-point number to allow for decimal input. The entered value is then stored in the variable number1.
number1 = float(input('Enter the first number:'))
#number2 = float(input('Enter the second number:')): Similar to the previous line, this line prompts the user to input the second number, converts it into a floating-point number, and stores it in the variable number2.
number2 = float(input('Enter the second number:'))

#product = number1 * number2: This line calculates the product of the two numbers entered by the user and stores the result in the variable product. It multiplies number1 by number2.
product = number1 * number2

#print('Product of two numbers:', product): This line prints the product of the two numbers. The text "Product of two numbers:" is displayed followed by the value stored in the variable product, which is the result of the multiplication operation.
print('Product of two numbers:',product)
