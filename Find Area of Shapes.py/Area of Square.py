#side1=float(input('Enter the value:')): This line prompts the user to input a value for the side length of the square. The input() function takes user input as a string, which is then converted to a floating-point number using the float() function and assigned to the variable side1.
Side1=float(input('Enter the value:'))

#area=side1*side1: This line calculates the area of the square by multiplying the side length (side1) by itself, which is equivalent to squaring the side length. The result is assigned to the variable area.
Area=Side1*Side1

#print('Area of the square is:',area): This line prints out the calculated area of the square. It uses the print() function to display the text "Area of the square is:" followed by the value of the area variable.
print('Area of the square is:',Area)
