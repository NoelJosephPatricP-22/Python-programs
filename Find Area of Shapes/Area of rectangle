#length=float(input('Enter the value of the length of the rectangle:')): This line prompts the user to input a value for the length of the rectangle. The input() function takes user input as a string, which is then converted to a floating-point number using the float() function and assigned to the variable length.
length=float(input('Enter the value of the length of the rectangle:'))

#breadth=float(input('Enter the value of the breadth of the rectangle:')): This line prompts the user to input a value for the breadth of the rectangle. Similar to the previous input line, it converts the user input to a floating-point number using the float() function and assigns it to the variable breadth.
breadth=float(input('Enter the value of the breadth of the rectangle:'))

#area=length*breadth: This line calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length (length) by the breadth (breadth). The result is assigned to the variable area
area=length*breadth

#print('Area of the rectangle is:',area): This line prints out the calculated area of the rectangle. It uses the print() function to display the text "Area of the rectangle is:" followed by the value of the area variable.
print('Area of the rectangle is:',area)
